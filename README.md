Common Child
A string is said to be a child of a another string if it can be formed by deleting 0 or more characters from the other string. Give two strings of equal length, what's the longest string that can be constructed such that it is a child of both?
For example, ABCD and ABDC have two children whit maximum length 3, ABC and ABD. They can be formed by eliminating either the D or C from both strings. Note thet we will not consider ABCD as a common child because we can't rearrange characters and ABCD <> ABDC.

Input Format
There is one line with two space-separated strings, s1 and s2.

Constraints
-1<=|s1|, |s2|<=5000
-All characters are upper case in the range ascii[A-Z]

Output Format
Print the length of the longest string s, such that s is a child of both s1 and s1.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
